# eBird Taxonomy

Keeping track of eBird/Clements Checklist annual taxonomy updates.

The Cornell Lab of Ornithology uses their own integrated taxonomy across eBird, Macaulay Library, Birds of the World, Merlin and other projects. This taxonomy checklist gets updated every October.

Taxonomy updates are necessary, but can be annoying, especially if you are using eBird datasets from different years -- while the whole database gets updated, your local files will instantly get outdated, especially if you use numeric codes for taxa. Cornell doesn't seem to keep archived historical taxonomy files, thus finding a year-old taxonomy can be tricky. I keep track of taxonomy files since 2021 and whoever needs those files is welcome to use them.
